## Conclusions

- Loans for which the income was completely not verified have a slightly higher chance of getting defaulted compared to those loans, where only income source was verified.
- The loans with a loan term of 36 months have defaulted more than loans with a total term of 60 months among defaulted loans
- More borrowers with 10+ years of employment have failed to repay a loan
- Compared to all employment length brackets, 10+ years borrower's income verification lacked the most. Also that is the biggest segment where only the source of income was verified.
- Segment with employment length brackets of less than 1 year is the second most lacking in income verification
- Most loans were given to the 10+ years segment and they have shown a steady defaulter rate
- 9 years segment was given the least number of loans but they have demonstrated good payback history
- D-grade loans tend to be defaulters.
- Most of the borrowers who took loan for debt consolidation purpose could not pay back the loans
- Most of the borrowers from CA has defaulted on loan pay back
- Most of the borrowers staying in rented houses/apartments were not able to repay the loan
- Seeing the trend, we can say people having salary ranging between 31k-58k have high chances of not able to repay the loan amount
- Trend shows when monthly installments are between 145-274 has higher propbablity of loans getting charged off
